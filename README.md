# LWT-Studio-Guests
Thank you for your RSVP to Live With Tricia Talk Show.  We look forward to seeing you on set during your scheduled recording time.  

Within a week of recording, you will receive a Zoom.us invitation for each of the shows you registered for.  Please be sure to download Zoom to your devise and feel free to become familiar with it so you don't feel panicked at that last minute.  Been there, done that.  :)

Also, we would love to spend as much time visiting with you as possible.  To receive your Backstage Pass for pre-show and post-show conversations, please visit www.livewithtricia.com/gigglegivers and choose the level of Giggle Giver you'd like to be.  It is not required to be a part of the live studio audience, but your support at any level will help LWT continue with success.  So thank you, in advance!!

Be sure to either add your scheduled times to your calendar with a notification, or you may choose to use the calendar option on the Google Form.  We look forward to seeing you in the Green Room 5 minutes before recording time.  Until then, let us know if you have any questions. 

Hoping you giggle so hard tears run down your legs.

Tricia Harmon
